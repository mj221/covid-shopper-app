Covid-safe shopping app (2020). This app aims to help stores regulate social distancing behaviours on top of being able to keep track of “crowdedness” in stores which in turn helps trace/track covid cases. Customers can also look up desired categories of items and products to get the most out of their time, with the help of a robust store recommendation feature which is calculated based on the number of local covid cases and items in stock.  

The application was built using Ionic React. See preview below:
