# Covid-Safe Shopping App (2020)
This app aims to help stores regulate social distancing behaviours by tracking “crowdedness” in stores with QR code. Has a store recommendation feature based on local cases. 

Customers can look up desired categories of items and products to get the most out of their time, with the help of a robust store recommendation feature mentioned above which is calculated based on the number of local covid cases and items in stock.  

The application was built using React Native with JavaScript and TypeScript.
